You are wrapping up a finished piece of work: merge the PR, delete the branch, close the
issue, and stop. This command is the user's explicit authorization to merge and delete — so
run the whole flow, but **stop immediately** (with a one-line reason) if any **Abort**
condition below trips. Do not start new work after finishing.

> Context: `jpeng-portfolio/website` is a static Next.js 16 site exported to `out/` and served
> from **S3 + CloudFront**. CI/CD is **GitHub Actions** with **Pulumi** IaC (`infrastructure/`,
> Pulumi Cloud, one `prod` stack). The default branch is **`master`**. A merge to `master` runs
> the **Deploy** workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): the reusable gates
> (`lint` → `typecheck` → `unit` → `e2e` + contact-Lambda `cargo test`), then a **two-phase
> `pulumi up`** — provision infra (`publishContent=false`) → read `contactApiUrl` → `npm run build`
> the static export → publish (`publishContent=true`: upload `out/` + invalidate CloudFront) — as
> the single `production` deploy. `deploy.yml` **ignores doc/tooling-only pushes** (`**.md`,
> `docs/**`, `.claude/**`, editor configs), so those merges produce **no** Deploy run.

## 0. Resolve the target
- `$1` may be a PR number **or** an issue number; if empty, use the open PR for the **current branch**.
- Establish three things:
  - **Branch** — `git branch --show-current`.
  - **PR** — the open PR for that branch (or the PR number in `$1`).
  - **Issue** — the issue this resolves: parse `Closes #N` / `Resolves #N` / `Fixes #N` from the
    PR body; else use the issue number in `$1`; if still unknown, **ask the user which issue** — never guess.
    (If the work genuinely has no tracking issue, that's fine — skip the issue steps.)
- **Abort** if the current branch is `master` (or `main`), or if no open PR exists for the branch.

## 1. Verify it's safe to merge
- Read the PR (`mcp__github__pull_request_read` or `gh pr view`): confirm it is **mergeable**
  (no conflicts), **not a draft**, and its **required checks are green** (statusCheckRollup / `gh pr checks`).
  The **PR** workflow (`pr.yml`) runs the gates (lint/typecheck/unit/e2e/lambda) plus a
  **`pulumi preview`** that comments the infra diff — the preview must be clean too, not just the tests.
- **Abort** with a one-line reason if checks are red, the PR is conflicted, or it's still a draft.
  Don't merge a red, conflicted, or draft PR.
- The repo **squash-merges**, so the **PR title becomes the commit subject** and must be a valid
  Conventional Commit (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, …). If the title isn't,
  fix it first (`gh pr edit --title` / `mcp__github__update_pull_request`) before merging.

## 2. Merge into master
- Squash-merge into `master` with `mcp__github__merge_pull_request` (`merge_method: "squash"`).
- Pass an explicit clean `commit_message` body (e.g. just `Closes #<issue>`) so the squash commit
  message stays tidy — GitHub builds the squash body by concatenating the branch's individual commit
  messages, and a clean body keeps the release/changelog history readable.
- Confirm it reports merged before continuing.

## 3. Delete the branch
- `git checkout master && git pull origin master` first — you can't delete the branch you're on.
- Delete the **remote** branch via the **GitHub API**, not `git push --delete`:
  `gh api --method DELETE repos/jpeng-portfolio/website/git/refs/heads/<branch>`
  (the ref path keeps any slashes in the branch name, e.g. `heads/claude/my-branch`).
  If the squash-merge already deleted the branch, this returns 404/422 — treat that as
  "already gone", not a failure.
- Then delete the local branch (`git branch -d <branch>`).

## 4. Update task status
For the resolved issue number (skip this whole step if there is no tracking issue):
- **Close the issue** (`gh issue close <n>` or `mcp__github__issue_write` state: closed).
- **Project board (only if one is configured).** This repo's `CLAUDE.md` does **not** pin a GitHub
  Project board or its field/option IDs. If the repo has a project board, resolve the project, the
  Status field, and the "Done" option IDs **at runtime** (`gh project list --owner jpeng-portfolio`,
  then `gh project item-list … --format json` to find the item id) and set Status → Done with
  `gh project item-edit`. If there is no board, **closing the issue is the done-state** — don't invent
  IDs. (There is no cycle-time `stamp` script in this repo; nothing to stamp.)
- If the issue is a **phase of an epic**, tick its checkbox in the epic issue body.

## 5. Watch the production deploy — don't walk away from a broken master
The squash-merge pushed to `master`, which triggers the **Deploy** workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
→ gates, then the **two-phase `pulumi up`** (provision `publishContent=false` → `npm run build` against the
live `contactApiUrl` → publish `publishContent=true`: upload `out/` + invalidate CloudFront). A merge that
red-deploys production is **not** "done", so watch this run to a terminal state before you stop.

- **Doc-only merge?** `deploy.yml` has `paths-ignore` (`**.md`, `docs/**`, `.claude/**`, editor configs). If
  every file in the merge matched those, **no Deploy run is created** — that's expected; note it and you're done.
- **Find the run.** Otherwise it's the `Deploy` run for the **merge commit** on `master`. Resolve the merge SHA
  (`gh api repos/jpeng-portfolio/website/commits/master --jq .sha`), then list recent master push runs with
  `mcp__github__actions_list` (`method: list_workflow_runs`, `resource_id: deploy.yml`, filter `branch: master`,
  `event: push`) and pick the run whose `head_sha` matches.
- **Wait for it.** The two `pulumi up` phases + the static build take several minutes (the `deploy-production`
  concurrency group never auto-cancels mid-run). Re-check the run's status periodically (every minute or two) —
  do **not** spin in a tight `sleep` loop. (`gh run watch` may not resolve the repo's remote in this environment;
  the MCP `actions_list` / `get_job_logs` tools and `gh api` with an explicit repo path always work.)
- **If it fails:** open the failing job's logs (`mcp__github__get_job_logs`, `failed_only: true`,
  `return_content: true`) and diagnose. Then:
  - **Flaky / infra** failure (transient AWS/network, a Pulumi Cloud hiccup) → re-run the run and re-watch.
  - **Real regression from this change** (a failing gate, or a bad `pulumi up` / `pulumi preview` diff) →
    fix it on a **new** branch + PR (never push to `master` directly), and tell the user.
  - **A `pulumi up` that errored mid-apply** is the dangerous case — infra state may be partially applied (e.g.
    failed between the provision and publish phases). Do **not** blindly re-run; read the error, check `pulumi`
    state if needed, and **stop and report** rather than risk a half-applied production stack.
  - If the fix is ambiguous or large, **stop and report the diagnosis** instead of guessing.
- **If it's green:** note that `production` deployed successfully (infra converged, site published, CloudFront invalidated).

## 6. Finish — then stop
Print a short summary and stop (end the turn; don't pick up new work):
- PR merged — link `https://github.com/jpeng-portfolio/website/pull/<pr#>`
- Branch `<branch>` deleted (local + remote)
- Issue #<n> closed · project Status = Done (if a board is configured)
- Production deploy: green ✅ (or: the failure diagnosis + what you did / what's blocked)

In headless `claude -p` mode the process exits here. In an interactive session the conversation
just goes idle — close it with `/exit` (or the tab) when you're ready.
